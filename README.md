# Sample application for the FETDD Dev Academy course

In this course we will build a Youtube viewer in React+Redux from the ground up using Test Driven Development (TDD). We will look at 
the Youtube site and ask ourselves, as we build each part of the viewer, what constitutes valid acceptance criteria. From these,
we'll write out in plain english our high-level test cases, and work backwards from there.

## Where do we start?
The first thing we're going to need is a search bar. What does a search bar do? How will we know if it's done?

### TODO:
- Search bar state acceptance criteria, written as if the feature is done

## Step 1
Recommended best practice when building Redux applications is to start by designing your state, so let's start there.

### TODO:
- High level test cases written in plain english (BDD-style)
- Run the tests and watch them fail
- Make the tests pass by implementing search bar state
- Refactor as needed
